        <h1>QUALITY STANDARDS</h1>
        <p>
          The Sri Lankan Tea industry maintains the highest quality in the
           world market and ISO 3720 is the minimum standard applied for the 
           products. The Country has the capability to produce the cleanest 
           tea in the world in terms of minimum pesticides and residues. <br/>
          <br />
           Methyl 
           Bromide was removed from the production process in 2012. Therefore,
           Sri Lankan tea has been identified as an “ozone free tea” in the world 
           trade. Sri Lanka is also adjusting well to the stringent ISO 22000 series 
           and to the health & safety regulations stipulated by the European Community.<br /><br />
