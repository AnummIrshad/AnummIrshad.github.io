        <h1>PEDRO TEA ESTATE</h1>
        <p>
          Sitting in the shadow of the lush greenery of Pidurutalagala, 3km east
          of Nuwara Eliya, Pedro Tea Estate was established on the very spot
          that James Taylor planted his first tea bushes and kick-started the
          Ceylon tea industry. Established in 1885, the factory was under
          British ownership until it was nationalised in 1975, before being
          reprivatised just a decade later. Despite its plantations and tea
          fields being less picturesque than others, it is one of the most
          easily accessible estates in the hill country and the 20-minute long
          tours take you through the entire manufacturing process, from grading
          to packaging, where you will see plenty of pieces of colonial-era
          equipment that is still in operation.

        <h1>DAMRO LABOOKELE TEA ESTATE</h1>
        <p>
          The expansive Damro Labookelie Tea Estate, set in 5000 acres or
          gorgeous rolling hillside 20km north of Nuwara Eliya, is much more
          scenic than Pedro Tea Estate with the surrounding countryside feeling
          much more unblemished and unspoilt. The factory was originally part of
          the MAckwoods conglomerate, founded in 1841 and nowadays contains a
          rather modern and visitor centre complete with a café where you can
          sample the estate’s teas. Due to its easy to each location on the main
          road between Kandy and Nuwara Eliya, the factory can become busy
          during the high season but the brief free tour gives a good overview
          of the production process.

        <h1>DAMBATENNE TEA ESTATE</h1>
        <p>
          The name Lipton is now synonymous with tea worldwide, but the Lipton
          empire had humble beginnings in Ceylon. In 1890, James Lipton stopped
          at the island en-route to Australia where he purchased a number of
          small, failing tea plantations in order to cut out the middleman in
          the burgeoning tea business that eventually grew into a global empire.
          Of all his plantations, he held Dambatenne in the highest regard. The
          factory can still be found between Haputale and Bandarawela,
          equidistant from both. While many of the tea factories around Sri
          Lanka have modernised, the slightly disheveled Dambatenne site still
          produces tea much the same as it did when it was first built in 1890,
          with the old machinery and process remaining unchanged for 130 years .

        <h1>HALPEWATTE TEA ESTATE</h1>
        <p>
          Being one of the biggest factories in the hill country, Uva Halpewatte
          tea factory is the perfect staring point for people looking to get to
          grips with Sri Lankan tea production. Dating from 1940, Halpewatte
          runs one of the best and most informative tours on the island, taking
          you through the process from picking to the final product. The factory
          is located just 5km north of Ella and most local tuk-tuk drivers will
          be able to take you there, although they can charge up to RS. 1000 for
          a return trip. Alternatively, the factory can be reached by taking two
          buses, first catching the bus towards Bandarawela and alighting at
          Kumbawela junction before hopping on an onward bus to Badulla.
